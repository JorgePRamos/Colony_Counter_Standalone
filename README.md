# Colony_Counter_Standalone
Stand alone algorithm used for counting bacteria colonies in different petri dishes (TSA, SDA ...).
Implemented in .NET making use of OpenCvSharp


### Problem Description:
A laboratory conducts bacterial colony counting using Petri dishes. Currently, the counting process is manual, requiring technicians to visually inspect each dish and count the bacterial colonies present. This method is time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacks efficiency. The laboratory seeks a more accurate, automated solution to streamline the process of counting bacterial colonies in Petri dishes.
